Sql-practice is a site designed to help people practice and learn sql by solving sql query problems.

sql-practice was written to use sql.js in a practical use. Implementing this site prior to sql.js would have required a lot of server cost but now it can be done on a static site.
sql.js uses emscripten to compile SQLite to webassembly.
